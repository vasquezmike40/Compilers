Your project is to use the grammar definition in the appendix 
of your text to guide the construction of a lexical analyzer.
My code specifically has multiple Arraylists created for the 
different token types. Then as the code runs it reads the input
file and compares to the array lists to see if it is an accepted 
keyword, delimiter, etc. The program also reads numbers  and determines 
whether or not it a float or int. All the while an error is thrown out
when when not matching any of the Arraylists. For the Identifiers token 
it reads letter by letter until reaching something other than a character
and then prints out the id.
